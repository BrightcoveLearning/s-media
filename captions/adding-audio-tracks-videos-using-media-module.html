    <p>Videos can be configured with multiple audio tracks. Multiple audio tracks can be used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play back the same video in different languagesâ€‚</li>
      <li>Provide audio with descriptions for the visually challenged</li>
      <li>Provide stereo vs. multi-channel (surround sound) audio</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Multiple audio tracks are supported for HLS V4+ and DASH - with and without DRM protection. Videos with multiple audio tracks will display a headphone icon (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/s-media-img/captions/node18591-headphone-icon.png" />) in the controlbar. When the icon is clicked, the viewer can select between audio tracks.</p>
    <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio source files can be in MP3, M4A, or WAV format.</li>
        <li>Your account must be enabled for multiple audio tracks. Contact your Customer Success Manager for details.</li>
        <li>All audio tracks must be added using the same <strong>ingest profile</strong> that was used to upload the video.</li>
        <li>By default, the audio <strong>Language</strong> is set to <strong>English</strong> with a <strong>Variant</strong> type of <strong>main</strong>. The default can be changed by checking the default option (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/media/default-button.png" />) when editing the Audio Track.</li>
        <li>When you add additional audio tracks to a video, they must all have the same bitrate/rendition profile to ensure successful playback in HLS (DASH playback will still work).</li>
        <li>Only one active ingest job is allowed on a video. Do not add an audio track until processing of the video has finished, and if you are adding multiple tracks, wait till each one has finished processing before adding another.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>The following limitations apply when using multiple audio tracks</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Audio masters not stored</dt>
      <dd>If you retranscode the video from the video master, the additional audio tracks will be lost, and must be re-added</dd>
      <dt>Audio-only files must be used</dt>
      <dd>Audio tracks must be audio-only files without video tracks</dd>
      <dt>HLSv3, HLS with audio and video in the same segment</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>The playback API will not return HLSv3 manifests</li>
          <li>All HLS manifests will include de-muxed video/audio</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Smooth Streaming</dt>
      <dd>Smooth Streaming URLs will not be available.</dd>
      <dt>Social Distribution</dt>
      <dd>It is not possible to select which audio track will be used for distribution. The track included in the video source (the muxed in audio) will be used, always.</dd>
      <dt>Ordering of audio tracks beyond the one "default" track</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>You can pick a default audio track with <span translate="No">CMS API</span> per title by setting the <code translate="No">is_default</code> field to <code translate="No">true</code></li>
          <li>There is also an account default, which can be set by Support</li>
          <li>This will only affect the "default" track in HLS manifests</li>
          <li>No other ordering is possible</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Ingesting more than one audio track from a single source</dt>
      <dd>We support <strong>one audio track from the source supplied in the source video.</strong>. Additional audio tracks must be ingested as separate audio files.</dd>
      <dt>DRM protection on videos that include only audio</dt>
      <dd>As soon as a video track is added, DRM protection will be enabled.</dd>
      <dt>End-user friendly labels</dt>
      <dd>We do not support custom labels for audio tracks. If you require that, you will need to make the change on the client side via the Player API.</dd>
      <dt>In some instances, switching tracks may cause the Brightcove Player to become unstable</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Track switching before all audio segments have been downloaded</li>
          <li>If the audio and video are different durations, the player will may stop whenever the shorter one runs out.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Video "duration"</dt>
      <dd>The video <code translate="No">duration</code> reported by the catalog/Playback API may be incorrect if the audio tracks have different durations.</dd>
      <dt>Videos shared from other accounts</dt>
      <dd>Audio tracks cannot be added to videos shared from other accounts, as this involves re-transcoding. Audio tracks need to be added to the account the video was shared from.</dd>
      <dt>Safari</dt>
      <dd>Brightcove has seen cases where Safari will not always load ng the audio track marked as default. Due to Safari loading content natively, the language settings of the device will take priority when determining the audio track to load.</dd>
      <dt>Cloud Playout</dt>
        <dd>Cloud Playout doesn't support <strong>Multiple Audio Track</strong>.</dd>
