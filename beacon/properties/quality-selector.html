      <p>The Quality Selector allows Beacon users to access, view, and select from various rendition levels, helping to choose the quality of the videos. Brightcove Player supports quality selection, so this implementation aligns with Brightcoveâ€™s support of this capability.</p>
      <p>By default, the player loads a rendition based on the platform's native behavior for each new session. The player will retain the quality selected during a session, so the app maintains the same quality selection when switching from one video to another. 
        Let's say you are watching Episode One and select a certain quality. The quality selection is maintained when Episode Two starts playing in the same session.</p>
